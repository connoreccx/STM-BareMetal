# STM32 Bare-Metal Programming (Learning Repository)

This repository contains my hands-on work, experiments, and reference code while completing the Udemy course **“Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming”** by Israel Gbati.  
The course focuses on low-level embedded development without using high-level libraries such as HAL or CubeMX, giving a deeper understanding of how microcontrollers work at the register level.

## 📘 Course Overview

The course teaches the fundamentals of embedded systems by directly manipulating microcontroller registers using C.  
Topics covered include:

- Understanding microcontroller architecture  
- Memory maps and the ARM Cortex-M core  
- Clock configuration and system startup  
- GPIO configuration at the register level  
- Timers, interrupts, and NVIC  
- UART communication without HAL  
- Writing linker scripts  
- Working with startup files and vector tables  
- Building bare-metal projects from scratch

The goal is to develop a solid foundation for writing efficient, low-level firmware that gives full control over hardware.
